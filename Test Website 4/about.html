          <h2>History of Video Games </h2>
          <p>The history of video games began in the mid-20th century with early experiments like Tennis for Two and Spacewar!, 
            laying the foundation for interactive digital entertainment. The 1970s saw the rise of arcade games and the first home consoles, highlighted by Ataris Pong, 
            which popularized gaming worldwide. The late 1970s and early 1980s marked the golden age of arcade games with classics like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. However, the industry faced a major crash in 1983 due to market oversaturation and low-quality titles. The revival came with Nintendo’s NES in 1985, reestablishing quality standards and introducing beloved franchises. The 1990s ushered in the era of 3D graphics and intense console competition, especially between Nintendo, Sega, and Sony’s PlayStation. Since the 2000s, video games have evolved with online multiplayer, mobile gaming, and immersive experiences through VR, becoming a major part of global entertainment culture.</p>

          <h2>The creation of video games</h2>
          <p>Creating a video game is a complex and collaborative process that involves many different stages and skilled professionals. It usually starts with concept development, where the games idea, story, characters, and gameplay mechanics are planned. 
            Designers and writers work together to outline how the game will look and feel. Next, artists create the visual elements like characters, environments, and animations, while programmers write the code that brings these elements to life and makes the game interactive. Sound designers and composers add music, sound effects, and dialogue to enhance the experience.
            Once the basic elements are created, the team moves into development and testing. Programmers build the game’s systems, such as controls, physics, and AI, while designers fine-tune gameplay to ensure its fun and balanced. Testers play the game repeatedly to find bugs and issues, providing feedback for improvements. 
            This cycle continues until the game is polished and ready for release. After launch, developers often continue to support the game with updates, patches, and new content to keep players engaged.</p>
